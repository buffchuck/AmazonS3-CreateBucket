# AmazonS3-CreateBucket
Create AWS S3 Bucket via Java SDK

This is a simple one class Java program built to learn about creating buckets in AWS S3 using the Java SDK.
This code example can be found in the AWS documents. Only minor changes have been made to prove out some of 
the AWS material's concepts. Happy coding!
